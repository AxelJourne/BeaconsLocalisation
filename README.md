# BeaconsLocalisation-MachineLearning
Indoor localisation system with BLE beacons using machine learning.

This application has several versions according to the algorithme you want to use.

Localisation uses a Machine Learning algorithm and has to be used with Data.
Localisation2 uses a classic algorithm, and has to be used with Data.
Localisation3 uses a Machine Learning algorithm, and has to be used with Data2.

According to the version that you use, don't forget to make the corresponding changes in the setting of the navigate bar.
